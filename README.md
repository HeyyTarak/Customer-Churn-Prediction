# Customer-Churn-Prediction

Customer Churn Prediction This project predicts customer churn using machine learning models. The dataset includes customer information, and the model is trained to predict whether a customer will churn or not.

Dataset The dataset used is Telco Customer Churn with features like gender, tenure, MonthlyCharges, etc. The target is Churn.

Process Preprocessing: Clean data, handle missing values, and encode categorical features. Modeling: Use Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost to train models. Evaluation: Models are evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. Prediction: The trained model predicts customer churn based on input data.
